Database Utility Projects Repository

The purpose of this repository is to add database utility projects. We ususally need customized tools which help us to develop and deploy database applications.

"MySQLDatabaseComparisonTool" is such a tool which helps us to compare two MySQL databases in a server. This helps us to track changes between development and test database. During deployment can use it and create database change script accordingly. It's  easy to use. We have to provide the MySQL server address, port number, user name, password, source database name and destination database name.


At present it has the following features:

1. Shows the number of tables, procedures and table constraints.
2. It can show the the tables not in destination database.
3. It also shows the tables not in source database.
4. You can get the differences in procedure definition.
5. The tool can show the mismatch between columns.
6. You can get the list of procedures not in destination database.
7. It can get you the procedures which are not in source database.

Please ignore my messy JAVA code as I am not expert on that :)

It would be great to hear from you, cause I believe feedback is love :)
